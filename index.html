                <h2>Hello!</h2>
                <p>My name is Alissa. I'm somewhat of a computer nerd in her early 20s.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I work in (industrial) cyber security, as a network/system engineer, mainly as a blue teamer. I'm into offensive security, web development, and tinkering on terminal applications. And, as you might have noticed, I have a soft spot for retro tech and the Geocities aesthetic...</li>
                    <li>In my free time I also like to draw/animate, read, bake and go wherever with friends. I'm currently working on a short comic that I'll also post on this website.</li>
                    <li><b>nymphali</b> is the handle that I took from an old friend.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This website is still very much a work in progress. Thank you for reading, and make sure to come back later! :-)</p>
